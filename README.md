# EDA for Business Insights: Global Electronics Data Analysis

**Overview**
This project involves performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Global Electronics' datasets to generate business insights that drive decision-making. The project can be completed in the following structured steps:

**1. Understand the Problem Statement:** Read and interpret the business objectives—enhancing customer satisfaction, improving operations, and increasing revenue.

**2. Explore the Datasets:** Review the provided datasets related to customers, products, sales, stores, and exchange rates.

**3. Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in columns and data types (e.g., date formats, numeric conversions).

**4. Data Transformation:** Merge datasets to create a unified view (e.g., join sales with customer and product data).

**5. Data Storage:** Insert the cleaned datasets into a structured SQL database, creating appropriate tables and relationships.

**6. Formulate Business Questions:** Identify 8–10 key business questions such as:
o	Who are the most valuable customers?
o	Which products are most profitable?
o	Which store performs best by region?

**7. Write SQL Queries:** Write SQL queries to answer the business questions and validate data relationships.

**8. Data Analysis:** Perform statistical and trend analysis such as average order values, product sales over time, store performance, and regional trends.

**9. Data Visualization:** Connect SQL database to Power BI or Tableau and create dashboards to present:
o	Customer segmentation
o	Product/category performance
o	Sales trends and forecasting
o	Store comparisons

**10. Insights & Recommendations:** Interpret findings to provide actionable recommendations (e.g., target customer groups, optimize inventory, price adjustments based on exchange rates).

**11. Final Report:** Compile your work into a structured report or presentation with charts, KPIs, and clear narratives supporting each business use case.

**Tools:**
Python: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and merging datasets using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL): Used for storing cleaned data and writing queries to extract insights from multiple tables.
Power BI / Tableau: Data visualization tools used to create interactive dashboards and present key insights.
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Environment used for running Python code, exploring datasets, and documenting the EDA process.
Excel: Used for initial data exploration, manual validation, and quick summaries before loading data into SQL.
